# Why hello there, fellow internet person
I'm noClaps, the most interesting boring person you've ever met. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

## Current projects
I assume you're here because you're interested in my work. Well, I have a few things going on at any given moment, and I'm never quite done with any of them, but here's a list of some of my projects:

- [ZeroLimits.dev](https://zerolimits.dev), my homepage. All of the websites I link below are accessible from here. It's really cool and took me a long time (and a lot of frustration, JavaScript can be hard) to get to the point it's at now, so check it out!
- [The Blog of Random](https://blog.zerolimits.dev), which as the name may suggest, is a blog about the most random things I can think of and find cool enough to write about. I have stuff about science, history, tech, privacy, security, whatever. Heavily inspired by [Answer In Progress](https://www.youtube.com/@answerinprogress), go check them out too!
- [Aperturic Focus](https://gallery.zerolimits.dev), a place for the best of my photography. I love to travel and take pictures, and I want to share them with the world, but I don't have (or want) an Instagram or Pixelfed account. And that's how Aperturic Focus was born, and it's only gonna keep growing from here.
- [links-template-astro](https://github.com/noClaps/links-template-astro), a template based on [omg.lol](https://omg.lol), built with Astro. This probably won't be updated very often, if at all (other than dependencies). Also, omg.lol is an amazing service (so I've heard) and it's way more polished and easy to use than this is, so if you're having trouble deciding between using this and buying an omg.lol address, in most cases I'd recommend you go for that instead.

If I start another project, I'll add that here too! I've got a few ideas about things I want to do, but haven't really gotten around to realising them. Call me lazy, I guess.

In the meantime, I've been learning Dart, and eventually I hope to learn app development with Flutter. If you're willing to teach me, contact me on Matrix below!

## Contact
As I mentioned before, I don't really have social media. That has its pros and cons (which is actually [something I wrote about](https://blog.zerolimits.dev/tech/be-social) in my blog!), one of them being I can be a bit hard to contact.

If you've got something to say about one of my projects, feel free to open an issue on the repository. I have those enabled for most of my projects. If issues aren't enabled, chances are I don't wanna hear what you have to say about it anyway, no offense. Some things are just for me.

However, if it's about something else, or you just wanna hang out and vibe, you can contact me on Matrix: https://matrix.to/#/@turbulent:matrix.org. Element can be a bit finicky sometimes, and I also may have other stuff to do, so apologies if I don't respond quickly. You can also find that link if you search for "Matrix" or "contact" on ZeroLimits.dev.

Please don't spam me.
